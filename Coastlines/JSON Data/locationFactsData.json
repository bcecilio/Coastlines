                "generalFacts": "New York State's extensive ocean coastline has places that we know, that we remember and that have shaped us in some way. More than 60 percent of New Yorkers live in homes on or near these waterfront areas. Each shoreline area is unique and part of the essence of New York. But these places will change as sea level rises, and the differences will become more obvious as the sea continues to rise to levels never experienced by humans. A result of the world’s changing climate, a rising sea will alter more than just the coastline. The entire state will feel the effects as residents and a significant amount of the landscape are affected. These areas are diverse and interconnected and share New York’s rich agriculture, commercial,economic and environmental history and resources.",
                "seaLevelFacts": "As shown in the graph below, the sea level rise projection in New York City is an increase of 4 to 8 inches in the 2020s, 11 to 21 inches in the 2050s, 18 to 39 inches in the 2080s, and 22 to 50 inches by 2100. Sea level rise is projected to accelerate as the century progresses and could reach as high as 75 inches by 2100 under the high estimate (90th percentile). New York City's sea level rise projections exceed the global average, primarily due to local land subsidence and global climate model projections that ocean height along the Northeast coastline may increase faster than global average ocean height due in part to projected weakening of the Gulf Stream current. The range of projected sea level rise grows as the century progresses, primarily because of uncertainties about how much the ice sheets will melt as temperatures rise.",
                "populationFacts": "One major feature of exposure to sea level rise and coastal flooding in New York State is its geographic concentration. 481,000 New York residents spread across 300 zip codes live on land below 6 feet; but 21% of them live in just 3 zip codes – for Manhattan Beach, Coney Island, and Far Rockaway.",

Coastal Louisiana’s wetlands, marshes, barrier islands and waterways protect coastal communities and the nation’s oil and gas infrastructure from tropical storm and hurricane wave and storm surge damage, provide essential navigation routes for national and international shipping and commerce for half of the United States, provide important habitat and food resources for some of our nation's most productive fisheries, and so much more.",

These conditions give much of the Louisiana coast a relative sea level rise rate that is among the highest in the nation. ",
                "populationFacts": "The fate of Coastal Louisiana is not certain. Home to 2/3rds of the state’s residents, from 1932 to 2010, Coastal Louisiana lost 1900 square miles of land, roughly an area the size of Delaware. If nothing is done to stop this land loss, Louisiana could potentially lose approximately 700 additional square miles of land, or an area equal to the size of the greater Washington D.C. – Baltimore area, in the next 50 years. In recent years, dire predictions of catastrophic consequences have fueled Louisiana's efforts to restore our failing coast. Louisiana's coastal wetlands stand on the verge of collapse. This land is not only important habitat for fish and wildlife, it provides an indispensable storm buffer for communities, transportation routes and energy infrastructure",

                "generalFacts": "\nThe 520-mile coastline of New York City has been a sparkling natural resource, a setting for commerce and industry, and a place for housing and recreation. \n\nThese areas are diverse and interconnected and share New York’s rich agriculture, commercial,economic and environmental history and resources. More than 60 percent of New Yorkers live in homes on or near these waterfront areas. \n\nThe importance of these coastlines will become more obvious as the sea continues to rise to levels never experienced by humans.\n\n A result of the world’s changing climate, a rising sea will alter more than just the coastline. The entire state will feel the effects as residents and a significant amount of the landscape are affected.",

                "populationFacts": "\nAs sea levels continue to rise, these neighborhoods will flood more frequently, while other low-lying neighborhoods that do not flood regularly with the tides will start to do so.\n\nIn addition to this regular flooding, sea level rise could also damage buildings by weakening structural elements and interfering with critical building systems.\n\n Rising sea levels will also increase erosion on the city’s beaches, reducing the level of protection they provide.\n\nCurrent projections indicate that, by the 2050s, approximately 43 miles of coastline — 8 percent of the city’s total excluding beaches and wetlands—could be at risk of daily or weekly tidal inundation during non-storm conditions.",

In recent years, dire predictions of catastrophic consequences have fueled Louisiana's efforts to restore our failing coast. Louisiana's coastal wetlands stand on the verge of collapse.

It has been estimated that by 2050, one in every seven people in Bangladesh will be displaced by climate change. Up to 18 million people may have to move because of sea level rise alone.",
